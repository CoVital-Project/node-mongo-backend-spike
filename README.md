# node-mongo-backend-spike
Prototypes for Hugo Esteves et al to get some node API services + NoSQL backend going

## Short term plan
Spike out an Express + Mongo prototype to be hosted on a simple VPS (digital ocean) with SSH access) as an outlet for any let's-get-this-going creative energies

## Midterm plan
- Extract node modules and API layer for porting to more scalable hosting configurations
- Separate database layer out to something like a PaaS mongo or DynamoDB setup
- Provide CI/CD to all authorized developers
